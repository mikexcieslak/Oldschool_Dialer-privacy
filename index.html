<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Oldschool Dialer app</strong> (the “App”) handles user data and permissions.
By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>
The App is designed as a functional rotary phone dialer. Its primary purpose is to allow users
to dial phone numbers using a circular dial interface and place phone calls directly from the App.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Phone Call Permission (CALL_PHONE)</h2>
<p>
The App requires access to the device’s phone calling functionality (<code>android.permission.CALL_PHONE</code>)
in order to place phone calls initiated by the user.
</p>

<p>
Phone calls are placed only after the user:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manually dials a phone number using the rotary dial interface</li>
  <li>Explicitly presses the <strong>Call</strong> button</li>
</ul>

<p>
The App does <strong>not</strong> place calls automatically, in the background, or without clear user interaction.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, process, or transmit:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Phone numbers</li>
  <li>Call history or call logs</li>
  <li>Call duration or metadata</li>
  <li>Contacts or contact information</li>
  <li>Personal or sensitive user data</li>
</ul>

<p>
All phone call actions are handled directly by the device’s operating system.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
The App does not share any phone-related data with third parties.
</p>

<p>
The App does not use phone functionality for analytics, advertising, profiling, or tracking purposes.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. User Control</h2>
<p>
Users can deny or revoke the phone call permission at any time through their device settings.
</p>

<p>
If the phone call permission is denied, the App will open the system dialer instead of placing
the call directly.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App does not integrate third-party services that access phone functionality or phone-related data.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any personal data from children.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page
with an updated revision date.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the App’s behavior, you may contact the developer
through the contact information provided on the app’s Google Play or App Store listing.
